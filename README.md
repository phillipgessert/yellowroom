_The Mystery of the Yellow Room_ is a locked-room mystery by Gaston Leroux. The book is in the public domain.

Gessert Books is an ongoing, umbrella project that aims to create deluxe ebook editions of public domain works. there ought to be a focus on both **style** and **technique**; where **style** is reflected through art direction and design, and **technique** is reflected through thoughtful coding.

This yellowroom repository is a home for my work in building an ebook edition of _The Mystery of the Yellow Room_. It's a document of the **technical** process I used to arrive at the finished ebook. Any sort of feedback is welcome, because the ultimate aim is to build a great book. Book design is something you're never really done learning, so I'm always curious about better ways to accomplish things.

For insights on the **style** end, I've got a [public Evernote notebook] (https://www.evernote.com/pub/phillipgessert/themysteryoftheyellowroom) available for viewing.

I'm also on [@phillipgessert on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/phillipgessert), and post updates there from time to time.
